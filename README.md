**Project 1. Quote Generator**

  Here, in this project I got an idea of how to use event listener(addEventListener), invokation and event propagation.
  I'm generating quote and author name using random value generated by Math.floor(Math.random()) and I created an const object which stores quotes and author name, and   according to it, assigns value **using innerText( used for security purpose, innerHTML should be avoided as it gives more authority to user to change HTML or JS            content)**.
