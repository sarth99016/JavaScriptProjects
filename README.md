# JavaScriptProjects

This Repository is created to practice JavaScript using project building

**Project 1. Quote Generator**

  Here, in this project I got an idea of how to use event listener(addEventListener), invokation and event propagation.
  I'm generating quote and author name using random value generated by Math.floor(Math.random()) and I created an const object which stores quotes and author name, and   according to it, assigns value **using innerText( used for security purpose, innerHTML should be avoided as it gives more authority to user to change HTML or JS            content)**.
  
 
**Project 2. Accordion**

 In this project, I created a menu that displays a list of headers with answers hidden stacked on top of one another.
 
CSS Learnings:
  These all are Flex Box Layout Module properties
    display:flex -> make sit easier to design flexible responsive layout structures without using float and positioning
    justify-content center -> alignment along the main axis
    align-items: center -> alignment along the cross axis

  display:
    inline -> any height and width properties will have no effect, displays in inline like span
    block -> starts on a new line takes the whole width
    flex -> Displays an element as a block-level flex container
    inline-block -> inline element where you can apply height, width properties
  
  position:
    static -> default(normal flow)
    relative -> positioned relative to its normal position, can set left,right,top, bottom, other content will not be adjusted to fit gap left by the element (can overlap)
    fixed -> positioned relative to the viewport, stay same even if the page is scrolled
    absolute -> positioned according to positioned ancestor (can overlap)
    sticky -> placed somewhere but it sticks according to user scroll
    
  JavaScript:
    // Variable

    const accordion = document.getElementsByClassName('content-container');

    for(i=0 ; i< accordion.length; i++){
        accordion[i].addEventListener('click',function(){
            this.classList.toggle('active'); // toggle class if it is present in element or not
        })
    };
